Find the largest pair sum in an unsorted array

Given an unsorted of distinct integers, find the largest pair sum in it. For example, the largest pair sum in {12, 34, 10, 6, 40} is 74.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n) [Only one traversal of array is allowed]

This problem mainly boils down to finding the largest and second largest element in array. We can find the largest and second largest in O(n) time by traversing array once.

Another solution is to sort the list using O(nLogn) time complexity in descending order and then take the first 2 elements.
